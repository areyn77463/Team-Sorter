# Team-Sorter
This is a small project I completed for coursework. It randomly sorts a list of names given in a .txt file into teams of even or uneven teams.

To use you must have a .txt file with all the names you are using inside the folder of the executable. The cli will show a menu giving you the options to create even or uneven teams and reshuffle for different teams.

I learned how to create both void and return functions; how to create functions with arrays as parameters; how to generate random numbers; how to read input files; how to manipulate output text.
